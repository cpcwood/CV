<p style='text-align: justify;'> I am a motivated and fast learning graduate, passionate about all things technology. I throughly enjoyed studying Mechanical Engineering at university, but I found that the programming I undertook in modules/projects was what really intrested and inspired me. So I've decided to make a switch and turn my hobby into my job and pursue a career in software development. 
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
I am hardworking and keen to learn anything, looking for a fast paced working environment on the forefront on technology.
</p>

While job seeking I will be working on the following:
* Cleaning up and refactoring projects created during Makers
* Nailing down my understanding of NodeJS and React by creating a website for my upcoming wedding ([repo](https://github.com/cpcwood/alice-and-chris-2021))
* Continuing to learn the fundamentals of Python via improving my machine learning project ([repo](https://github.com/cpcwood/neural-nets))
* Pi based VPN and home webserver (<a href='https://www.cpcwood.com/say-hello' target="_blank">Say Hello</a>)



## Skills

#### Problem Solver

I love to solve problems, both for fun and in work. The more complex, the better. If I dont have to start drawing things out to keep track the problem, it wasn't hard enough.

Having solved problems before, what makers taught me is the process in which to follow when stuck or something goes wrong
