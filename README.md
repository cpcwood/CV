  Hi, I’m Chris Wood, a full-stack software developer based in London, UK. 
</p>

<p align='justify'>
  I have always had a strong passion for technology and picked up software development during my Mechanical Engineering degree. More recently, I undertook a bootcamp at <a href='https://makers.tech' target="_blank">Makers</a>, to learn web development and turn my passion into a career. 
</p>

<p>
  I love learning about and building anything technical, and occasionally, I write a <a href='https://cpcwood.com/blog' target="_blank">blog</a> on things I find interesting.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
  I'm currently open to remote work based in Ruby and JavaScript stacks.
