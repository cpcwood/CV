  Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Wood, a full-stack software developer based in London, UK. 
</p>

<p align='justify'>
  I have always had a strong passion for technology and picked up software development during my Mechanical Engineering degree. More recently, I undertook a bootcamp at <a href='https://makers.tech' target="_blank">Makers</a>, to learn web development and turn my passion into a career. 
</p>

<p>
  I love learning about and building anything technical, and occasionally, I write a <a href='https://cpcwood.com/blog' target="_blank">blog</a> on things I find interesting.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
  I'm currently open to remote work based in Ruby and JavaScript stacks.
</p>

Freelance work to design, develop, and host the site for the When Unicorns Fly podcast. The site's public side displays information on podcasts allowing for filtering by podcast topic, direct streaming, and linking to popular podcast streaming services.

Some of the challenges I encountered were:
- Converting client requests into features on a tight timeline
- Handling react state for user sessions and AJAX resource requests to the backend API
- Mitigating against common security threats such as CSRF
- Dynamic rendering the SPA for SEO and social media bots
- Developing a custom multer storage engine to transform images and analyse audio before uploading to AWS S3
