# Christopher Wood

I am a motivated and fast learning graduate, passionate about all things technology. I throughly enjoyed studying Mechanical Engineering at university, but I found the programming I undertook in modules/projects was what really intrested and inspired me. So I've decided to make a switch and turn my hobby into my job and pursue a career in software development.
