<p align='justify'>
I am a motivated and fast learning graduate, passionate about all things technology. I throughly enjoyed studying Mechanical Engineering at university, but I found that the programming I undertook in modules and projects was what really intrested and inspired me. So I've decided to make a switch and turn my hobby into my job and pursue a career in software development. 
</p>

<p align='justify'>
I am a hardworking individual who is keen to learn anything and is looking for a fast paced working environment on the forefront on technology.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
While job seeking I will be working on the following:
<ul>
  <li>Cleaning up and refactoring projects created during Makers Academy</li>
  <li>Nailing down my understanding of NodeJS and React by creating a website for my upcoming wedding (<a href='https://github.com/cpcwood/alice-and-chris-2021' target="_blank">repo</a>)</li>
  <li>Continuing to learn the fundamentals of Python via improving my machine learning project (<a href='https://github.com/cpcwood/neural-nets' target="_blank">repo</a>)</li>
  <li>Pi based VPN and home webserver (<a href='https://www.cpcwood.com/say-hello' target="_blank">Say Hello</a>)</li>
</ul>
</p>

## Skills

#### Problem Solver

<p align='justify'> 
I love to solve problems, both for fun and in work. The more complex, the better. I like to think, if I haven't had to start drawing things out to keep track of the problem, it wasn't hard enough.
</p>

<p align='justify'> 
Having solved problems throughout my life, from modelling dynamic systems in my degree to managing tricky remdial works in a occupied building. Makers has taught me the processes which to follow when first planning a problem and when something goes wrong. 
</p>

<p align='justify'> 
I throughly enjoy solving Codewars katas and try to keep up completing one a day. I find seeing other programmers solutions both fansinating as its probably one of the best ways to learn a new syntax quickly. Checkout my <a href='https://github.com/cpcwood/Codewars' target="_blank">solutions</a> and <a href='https://www.codewars.com/users/cpcwood' target="_blank">profile</a> if you like.
</p>

#### Analytical Thinker

<p align='justify'> 
Theres no point solving problems if you solve the wrong problems. I'm a big fan of thinking first and working out the edge cases before devising the solution. This approach allows for a much better, holistic picture of what the work entails and guides the design of the first tests.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
Analytical thinking has been engrained into me throughout my education, however more recently Makers taught me how to apply this skill to programming. An example of this was during planning the the game model for the Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge, I realised the rules for the extended game could be modelled using an equation. Then to solve this I created a module which allows for any size of RPS game providing it follows the rules. Take a look at the module <code>lib/rps_extended.rb</code> <a href='https://github.com/cpcwood/rps-challenge' target="_blank">here</a>
</p>

<p align='justify'> 
Another point in the course where I found my analytical approach useful was in the Bowling Scorecard challenge, which turned out to be deceptivly complex to model, since the rules of bowling allow for strikes and spares to take into account the scores rolled in subsquent frames. After approximately 4 hours of configuring possible solutions, to reduce the excessive amount of logic, I refined my approach. I modelled each frame as its own object containing the logic for it to 'listen' for the right number of rolls and return a score when complete. Take a look at the script <code>public/scripts/frameModel.js</code> <a href='https://github.com/cpcwood/bowling-challenge' target="_blank">here</a>
</p>


#### Team Player

<p align='justify'> 
Cycling Land's End to John O'Groats, undertaking £2 million of remedial works in an occupied building, and developing code effectively, all have one major component in common, teamwork. I have always found that being in a team, has been critical to maximising productivity, getting a positive outcome, and general happiness in a project. 
</p>

<p align='justify'> 
In the workplace, having peer accountability,setting goals, and utilising Agile processes have driven my team and I to produce some great work even in short timeframes. For example, in our final project at Makers <a href='https://github.com/cpcwood/technodactyl-studios-dinorun' target="_blank">Dinorun</a>, without having prior experience in game development or music analysis within the team, we managed to develop a music based procedurally generated game 2D, which scales to browser size. Give it a play <a href='https://technodactyl-studios-dinorun.herokuapp.com/' target="_blank">here</a> and try to beat our topscores.  
</p>

#### Self-driven

<p align='justify'> 
I am self driven by both goals and curiosity, finding that if there is something to achive or complete it makes working hard much easier. While at Makers a friend explained the wonders of machine learning to me, which spiked my interest and I ended up setting the goal of creating a multilayered perceptron from scratch in python. After a week or so of researching in my spare time I had achieved my goal and the neural network could correctly classify 2D datasets. You can take a look at the developing project <a href='https://github.com/cpcwood/neural-nets' target="_blank">here</a>.

<p align='justify'> 
In my spare time, I enjoy learning about technology and other skills. Checkout my <a href='#interests'>Interests</a> at the bottom of the page to see some examples.
